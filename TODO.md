# TODO


1. replace the action state system with a database system instead of a file system
3. create a new project management bot and /task command to interact with that bot
DONE 4. add a tool approval wrapper 
DONE 5. add a forget command, which takes human readable input, finds relevent memories, and provides approval flows to delete each result.
6. create a better way to inject context and a summary of a tool call approval into the wrapper. create a list of tool calls that need approval to run
