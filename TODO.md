# TODO


1. replace the action state system with a database system instead of a file system
2. hook up a jira mcp
3. create a new project management bot and /task command to interact with that bot
4. add a tool approval wrapper
5. add a forget command, which takes human readable input, finds relevent memories, and provides approval flows to delete each result.
